React, Redux, d3, and jupyter.

This is an example of a React-redux-d3 javascript library that runs in the Jupyter notebook off of data from `networkx` graphs and `pandas` `DataFrames`.

The communication between *react* components is coordinated with *redux*.  In this case, there are five: toolbar, stacked area graph, legend, network, and table. Since there are not explicit callback functions from each graph, more complex examples are possible.

Here are a few examples:

The code will be available soon.
